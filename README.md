# Art Shop

## Project still in progres...

In this project I build a shop for artworks based on Vite, Chakra and React (with react-query, react-router, state management with zustand).
The API of the Art Institute of Chicago is used to retrieve data and images: https://api.artic.edu/docs/.

This will not be a fully functional online shop but a small project to practice fetching and caching data, aswell as managing global state in react.
