# DreamsCars - A Car Shop Project

## Project still in progres...

In this project I build a shop for Cars based on Vite, Chakra and React (with react-query, react-router, state management with zustand).
This is currently a frontend project. The backend will be added later on.

This will not be a fully functional online shop but a small project to practice fetching and caching data, aswell as managing (global) state in react.

Very early stage preview, not the the final product:
